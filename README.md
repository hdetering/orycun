This repository describes the analysis pipeline used in an association study of an Australian rabbit population.

This repository is structured as follows:
/		- basic scripts to process the raw sequencing data
|- allegro	- scripts used on the server side
|- gene_based	- code to aggregate SNP data to gene level
|- GO		- code to retrieve Gene Ontology data from Ensembl db
|- meta         - meta information about the population studied
|- results      - output files generated by the analysis steps

# Outline

In this study, DNA from 81 individual rabbits were sequenced using the Genotyping-by-Sequencing ([Elshire2011][1]) protocol.
